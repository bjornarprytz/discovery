"The pun is mightier than the word"

## Stipulation: Text based

try to find as many words as possible

Goal: collect specific words to increase high score

## 1.0 roadmap

- Show multiplier
  - rework
    - If you finish a quest, you become Golden
    - When you're Golden, multiplier goes up 1 when finishing a word
    - If you miss a quest, you lose Golden

- UI
  - If player is inactive on the first move, highlight the options (scale up and down)
  - Add a few buttons to cover: Retry, quit, options/corpus (maybe in a later version?)
  - On death: Dead end!

- Rules description: in the options menu

- Bigger corpus (Complete Alice in Wonderland?)
- Credits
  - Sound effects
  - Font
