"The pun is mightier than the word"

## Stipulation: Text based

try to find as many words as possible

Goal: collect specific words to increase high score

## 1.0 roadmap

- Indicate when a new quest is begun (Sheen effect over the new word)
- Indicate when quest duration is changed (like a slot machine (move it down, and the next number slides down to take its place))

- UI
  - If player is inactive on the first move, highlight the options (scale up and down)
  - On death: Cornered!
  - Show multiplier
  - Indicate better when a target word is found (A matching jumping effect?)
  - Slightly faster camera movement

- Bigger corpus (Complete Alice in Wonderland?)
- Credits
  - Sound effects
  - Font
